Work in progress scripts that will allow muliple players the ablity to play a crude battleship game over the internet

All you need to chage the ip in client to the ip address of the server 
Make sure the ports match each other 
Then start the Server first 
Then start the Clients

For use over lan use the servers lan ip for the client Match sure if you can the port the server and client ports match

For use over wan use the server internet ip given from your isp for the client Make sure you create port forward for the port the server is going to use if neccasary You can search Google on how to do that

Currently in the bug fixing stage so comment if any happen for you

What I would like to add to the code is encrytped connnection and a gui
